# Welcome
Hi! This is just some of the projects or important pipelines that I had done during my master degree in bioinformatics.

I thought it would be a waste to just let it sit on my local computer and thought this would be helpful for someone that required this.

Of course there is much to learn and I will update it over time!

However, hit me up for any question or inquiries through vicsjalim@gmail.com

# Projects
- Exposome on Children sLRTI: This was my personal project to analysed exposome (collection of exposures throughtout lifetime) and its relationships with sLRTI in children. This is the longest project that I have done (please do visit it) through Exposome-Rproj. The project utilzed **R** ☺️

- Cancer Genomics: In here, we utilized the genomics data to detect somatic and germline mutations that can lead in cancer. By identifying which genes that resposible for the disease and to predict the cancer type. Therefore, we can give certain medication for right cancer treatment. We used **bash or command line**.

 - De Novo genome assembly: This pipeline was developed for bacterial genome, which is smaller genomes compared to eukaryotic genomes. We also did some phylogenetics analysis to discovered which species is closer to our non-identified species. We used **bash or command line**

- ChiP-Seq: Utilized ChiP-Seq pipeline to discover the CTCF region in *D. Melanogaster*. We used **bash or command line**. 

- The Single cell transcriptomics (scRNA): The scRNA were more popular right now. In here, we do data cleaning, used machine learning for classification of the PBMC data. We used **python** package scanpy. However, there most popular package is using Seurat in R.
